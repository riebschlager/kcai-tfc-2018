## Housekeeping

## HTML

- What is it?
- What can you make with it?
- What are tags?
- What are attributes?

## Let's Learn Some Tags

- `<html>`
- `<head>`
- `<body>`
- `<p>`
- `<h1>` through `<h6>`
- `<em>`
- `<strong>`
- `<img>`
- `<div>`
- `<a>`
- [And Many More!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

## Now It's Your Turn

- Create a new file `yourname.html`
- Make your own online store. Sell your work and/or services.
- Use all of the tags above.
- Sell at least five items or services.
- Stuff you could include: Titles, descriptions, prices, about the artist, contact info, images and links.
- Bonus: Use a tag we didn't talk about.
- Double Bonus: Embed content from elsewhere. (YouTube, Vimeo, Soundcloud)
- Include a link back to our home page: `index.html`
