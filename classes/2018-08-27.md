## Quick Review

## Let's Try Something New

- Let's use [this project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/equal-surf)
- Move CSS into its own file
- More fonts! [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [So many CSS Rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)
- `width`
- `height`
- `margin`
- `padding`
- `border`
- `border-radius`
- `postition-absolute`
- `top`
- `left`
- `bottom`
- `right`
- CSS for layout using [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox)

## Now _You_ Try

- Make a [Movie Poster](https://glitch.com/~movieposters)
