## Tell Me a Story

Technology allows us to tell stories in new and interesting ways. Stories don't necessarily need a beginning, middle and end, or a static cast of characters. Using the skills we've learned, I want you to construct a story. Carefully consider the story you want to tell and invent compelling ways to tell it.

## Requirements

- Your story should present an original narrative in a interesting way.
- Present your story using the web technologies we've learned using glitch.com to host your project.
- Make use of the HTML and CSS we've learned, experiment with tech we haven't talked about yet.
- The viewer should have some agency in your story.
- You will present your work to the class for discussion and critique.

## Due Date

October 1st
