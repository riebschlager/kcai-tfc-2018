# Project Two

## Create a Game

Make a game! What is or isn't a game is up to you. Ideally, your game will be a playable experience that responds to user input. Feel free to use any combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript that you are comfortable with. Use third party libraries if you'd like.

## Requirements

- Present your gmae using the web technologies we've learned using glitch.com to host your project.
- Make use of the HTML and CSS we've learned, experiment with tech we haven't talked about yet.
- You will present your work to the class for discussion and critique.
